Baptist History Timeline
========================

A [class project](http://blogs.duncanjohnson.ca/th106-2013/project/) created by students in [Th106 Baptist History](http://blogs.duncanjohnson.ca/th106-2013/) at [Foundation Baptist College](http://foundationbaptistcollege.ca/), Edmonton, AB during the Fall 2013 semester.

As code, the project is more or less just a fork of my other timeline projects, [History of the English Bible][english-bible] and [Isaiah Visualizations][isaiah]. The key functional difference is that this timeline ingests its event data from Google Spreadsheet that my students contribute to, rather than a raw JSON object in a file.
